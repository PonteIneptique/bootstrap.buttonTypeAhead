#buttonTypeAhead
=========================

##What is buttonTypeAhead (BTA) for
BTA is at the crossing way of a enhanced select like chosen and an input typeahead. It provides you a typeahead which will look for an ajax source. Clicking on a typeahead value will drop either an hidden value in a span (Select multiple) or disable the input ( Select Single ).
The most interesting is that if you do want your user to save new datas, a save method is provided and will add it through ajax as well as a preexisting value.
